First off, I wanted to, in a non-douchy way, say this: **I&rsquo;ve been into these guys for a while now.** And it&rsquo;s pretty awesome to see something like this happening; for them of course, but more selfishly validating my own musical styling.

Every now and again a band does it. **They blow up**, everywhere. From seemingly nowhere (just lots of underground fandom), to [David Letterman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ee4bfu_t3c) and [then to SxSW](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/damon-albarn-future-islands-win-sxsws-2014-grulke-prize-20140319).

Go see them somewhere near you asap; and [give their new album a listen](http://www.npr.org/2014/03/16/286898446/first-listen-future-islands-singles) on NPR, or get it when it comes out.
