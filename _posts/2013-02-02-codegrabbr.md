##design + ruby on rails + front-end

Need an HTML character, but don't know the actual code? No problem, just search for what type of character you need, and this spits out whatever is closest. Plus, it's got Unicode as well, in case you want that too.

###What I Did

- designed / built app because I wanted a **simple site for nice HTML code searching**
- focus on search interaction & results to help you find the code you need quickly
- built to work on small and large screens; aka RWD
