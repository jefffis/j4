###tech stuff
##I did the design, front-end, ruby on rails and heroku setup

Built because there are many times where clients have handed over content, after the design phase completes, and then when they see the content on staging or live, do not like how it flows. Plus, being able to **view the content in a semi-live state** helps the author to massage it and iterate it to a better place.
