intro: <strong>Designers! Developers!</strong> Listen, listen! We must stop our collective nonsense. We&rsquo;re putting our likes ahead of user needs, and letting our preferences cloud our products. Using antialiased text (albeit limited to webkit, possibly blink, browsers) is a bad, poor, erroneous choice.
