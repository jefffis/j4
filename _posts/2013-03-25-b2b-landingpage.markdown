## design

Working with a B2B client who is having issues getting users to fill out their AMS assessment form, so I've been iterating on designing a more engaging, useful, and informational landing page. For starters, they had about 20 fields on their form, so I stripped this down to 3. Then, I **added a simple, strong headline and CTA** to the top of the page.

I then added a directional, bulleted list _(the screen of the computer will be rotating through graphical accompanyments, or that's the plan as of now)_ to help guide users through to the form. If that doesn't convince them to fill the form out, I added some **simple, easy-to-scan copy breaking down the pluses of their software, as well as visual steps** as to what happens when a user fills out the form.

And if that doesn't help them out, I added in generic messaging about the company as to why the user should want to work with them, as well as another CTA at the bottom.
