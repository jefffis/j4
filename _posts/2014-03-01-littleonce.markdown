intro: <strong>A simple, secure, fun daily journaling app for your child.</strong> Just take a photo, add a description to preserve the memories forever, and post it; that&rsquo;s all. A Ruby on Rails app, I designed and built the UI &amp; front-end, and did a fair amount of the Rails work, with a bit o&rsquo; help from a friend.

##I did the design, front-end, (some of the) ruby on rails, S3 and a bit of the digital ocean setup

I built this because my wife and I felt there was a need for this type of thing on the market: a private, daily journal for your child. **Being anti-Facebook,** and just having had our first child ourselves, we felt it just made sense.
