					<h2>Good design follows naught</h2>

<p>With a few exceptions, <em>those being proven mathmatecal principals</em>, good design is agnostic of time. Good design is in and of itself. Sure, this is hard to do in web design as the web changes literally every day; but the concept is still applicable. I&rsquo;m not saying you should design a site once and never update it; that&rsquo;s tomfoolery. I&rsquo;m merely refering to the design impications of taking so-called &lsquo;trends&rsquo; and applying them to your client work. Why would we do such a thing? Outside of generic design direction (i.e. golden ration, whitespace, etc.), how can trends apply to the unique problem you are attempting to solve?</p>

<p>So why is this such a pervasive issue in our practice? Why are there so many articles about design trends, and why do so many designers read &amp; follow these?</p>

<h2>To stay up-to-date?</h2>

<p>There can be an argument made for wanting to stay up-to-date on things. <strong>Eh; maybe.</strong> But more likely it&rsquo;s because designers don&rsquo;t know better than to not use things they see as popular. <strong>Being popular isn&rsquo;t always a good thing</strong>. Being popular isn&rsquo;t the same as being effective. This is a huge concept that is being lost on many web designers nowadays.</p>

<h2>But it&rsquo;s beautiful</h2>

<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how erronesously used this word is every day. <strong>The purpose of design is not to make beautiful things.</strong> That is making art. The purpose of design is to make something that solves a problem, and thus is effective. Look at any startup or app these days, beautiful is used all too often to describe what the app does.</p>

<p><em>Build beautiful websites.</em> This is the kicker for me. In 99 out of 100 cases, no where does the app describe if what they produce will be effective or problem-solving. If you are a business owner and you want results, do you really care if your website is <em>beautful or not?</em> No, not really; you want results. <strong>You care if you make money or lose money.</strong> If, in the process, your get an aesthetically pleasing site, awesome. But, our job as designers is, first and foremost, to solve a problem. <strong>One that rarely is the lack of beauty.</strong></p>

<h2>Wrapped up in the wrong things</h2>

<p>Sliders. Sliders everywhere. Or carousels, whatever you call them. But they exist everywhere because they became trendy. And then they were a must have. But why? What business goals were they acheiving? <a href="http://conversionxl.com/dont-use-automatic-image-sliders-or-carousels-ignore-the-fad/">None</a>. And yet, almost every site you visit had this at some point; if they do not still have them.</p>

<p>Responsive web design. Need I say more? The concept is great, but the results are generally not. <em>Bloated ass webpages are the result.</em> What about our users who need to sit and wait and wait and wait for these &lsquo;beautifully&rsquo; designed page to download on their phones? Do we care about their data charges, or the fact that even though the site <em>fits</em> a mobile screen, it&rsquo;s too large to realistically use?</p>

<h2>Invisible design is not trendy</h2>

<p>The sad fact of trends is they almost solely focus on what&rsquo;s visible, or tangible. Not the <strong>invisible design details</strong>; which could be argued are the most important parts. If the sites doesn&rsquo;t load, or at least give the impression loading, boom, user gone.</p>
